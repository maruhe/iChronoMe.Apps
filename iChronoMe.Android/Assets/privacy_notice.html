    The app was created and is still being developed as part of a scientific experiment. <br />
    As a user of iChronoMe, you are, so to speak, a test object and observer in one, while the app serves as a tool. <br />
    The use itself is explicitly outside of any legal framework or similar fictions! <br />
    On your part, there is <b> no </b> claim to a <b> guarantee </b> that the <b> information </b> that is displayed in this app or otherwise processed, actually <b> is correct </b>. <br />
    This app was created by someone who has not studied computer science or astronomy or anything else. <br />
    If you really want to know exactly what time it is, build a <a href="https://ecosia.org/search?q=greatest+sundial"> 100-meter sundial </a>. <br />
    There is no guarantee that the app will still be available tomorrow or that it will work at all, so you better enjoy every moment. <br />
    <br />
    All source code can be found on github.com and can be used as desired. <br />

    <br /> <br />
    &#9679;  Geocoding <br />
    External services from various providers are used to provide a location with a nice title or to determine information about time zones. <br />
    Here the longitude and latitude of the location is sent via Internet<br />
    Conversely, e.g. if you enter a location in an appointment with the help of such services the App tries to find the corresponding location to be able to correctly calculate the solar time of the appointment. <br />
    <br />
    &#9679;  local cache <br />
    In order to save data and battery, location information is temporarily stored, regardless of whether it is your real location or you choose a location on the map. <br />
    This data is of course stored in such a way that usually no other app can access it. (may except special system apps or your device is "rooted") <br />
    In 'settings' you have the possibility to empty this buffer at any time. <br />
    The same happens if you clear the cache in the system settings of your device. <br />
    <br />
    &#9679;  some information about usage is collected so iChronoMe roughly recognizes whether it is used little or rather intensively. This data also remains exclusively in a locally protected memory and currently serves no purpose. <br />
    For example this will allow us, not annoying you to rate the app before you finished reading this text. <br />
    <br />
    &#9679;  Otherwise, iChronoMe only transfers data if you expressly allow it: <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; When errors occur <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226; When sending a support request <br />
    For these cases, a kind of random character string was generated, which should enable developers to recognize when several errors occur on the same device. <br />
    Since this is an cryptical identifier, there should be no way to identify you or anything like that. <br />
    <br />
    &#9679;  All data traffic is SSL-encrypted <br />
    <br />
    &#9679;  This clauses can be changed at any time and you will get informed at the following app-update<br />
    <br />
    so, all the best <br />
